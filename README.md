### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Most of my recent repos are private and I've contributed to a few private repositories professionally for a couple of years now. Most of the public repos here are from when I was in school or just mucking about with random things.

**Professional History:**

* Getaround Apps (2019)
  * Android App
  * An "Internal" Flutter App
* Capital One Android App (2017-2018)
* Backend Services at Capital One (2016-2017)

**Interests**
* Mobile
* Full-stack Web
* Game dev

**Currently Learning**
* Rust
* Music Production

**Let's collaborate**

I only have one project that I think is worth collaborating on at the moment - a few others are just too early on.
Let me know if you're interested in helping me build _my (or our)_ perfect songwriting notebook. Just hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quentintopper/). I don't really use Twitter or other social media.
